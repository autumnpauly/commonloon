# Background Information
## Introduction
Although Common Loons (Gavia immer) have been studied extensively during the breeding season not much is known of their behavior on their ocean wintering grounds, where Loons spend a significant part of their lives (Bent, 2009). The few studies that do look at winter behavior often yield conflicting results (McIntyre, 1978; Daub, 1989; Ford and Gieg, 1995). The possible use of different shoreline habitats for activities such as feeding, sleeping, or taking shelter is worthy of study. McIntyre (1978) found common loons were semi-social and formed loose rafts and that loon behavior varied with tides, weather, and time of day. Daub (1989) and later Ford and Gieg (1995) found refuting evidence suggesting loons were neither social nor territorial, and did not change their behavior much by tide. Holm and Burger (2002) found that the general pattern for loons was that they foraged during slack and main-flow water. Additionally, the possible difference in dive times as a result of varying tidal heights is worthy of study. Thompson and Price (2006) observed that dive times were longer during low tide in comparison to other tidal stages, though more studies should be conducted to assess the use of tidal stage and behavior. 

Our general hypothesis when analyzing this data is that environmental conditions affect the behavior of the G. immer. The null hypothesis to this statement is that environmental conditions do not affect the behavior of the G. immer.

## Methods
In 2023, observations were conducted at nine established observation sites along the coastline of Mount Desert Island in Hancock County (Maine). Observations occurred from January 2023 to March 2023 on a biweekly basis, where each waterfowl individual was recorded as well as their behaviors, referencing Daub’s (1989) list of behaviors, and coordinate location. Locational coordinates were obtained by estimating the individual’s rough location digitally (accurate to + or - 10 m). Each transect site was visited for roughly 5-10 minutes, where data collection followed initial observation. Utilizing a Kestrel 2500, weather data was recorded accurately to + or - 1°C of temperatures and within 3% of wind speed. Referencing Daub’s (1989) list of behaviors, each species’ behavior during the observation was noted. The weather and environmental data recorded included wind speed and direction, barometer, cloud cover, precipitation, humidity, temperature, tidal percentage, and wave class (Beaufort Wind Speed). Tidal data was gathered from NOAA’s digital tidal charts. This study was repeated in 2024 with the addition of observational variables including species dive times and tidal height.

Null Hypothesis: Tidal height will not have a significant effect on G. immer behavior

### Chi-Squared Test of Independence
The Chi-Squared Test of Independence examines whether there is a relationship between two categorical variables. Our null hypothesis, that tidal height will not have a significant effect on G. immer behavior, assumes that tidal condition and behavior are independent. Our hypothesis, that tidal height will have a significant effect on G. immer behavior, assumes that tidal condition and behavior are dependent.

#### Expected Frequencies and Contingency Table
Before performing the chi-square test, we need to calculate the expected frequencies for each cell in the contingency table. These expected frequencies represent what you would expect to observe if there were no association between tidal condition and behavior.

```{r contingency-table}
contingency_table1 <- table(loons_2023$tide, loons_2023$behavior)
contingency_table1
```

#### Chi-square Test
Now that we have the contingency table of expected frequencies, we can perform the statistical test. 

```{r chi-square-test}
chi_sq_test1 <- chisq.test(contingency_table1)
chi_sq_test1

# # x-squared
# chi_sq_test1$statistic
# 
# #p-value
# chi_sq_test1$p.value
# 
# #expected frequencies
# chi_sq_test1$expected
```

REPORT: The behavior of Common Loons is dependent on tidal condition (Pearson's Chi-squared test; X-squared = 33.184, df = 10, p-value > 0.005).

<!-- #### ANOVA -->
<!-- If we want to compare the abundance of diving behavior between the three tidal stages (high tide, mid tide, and low tide), we need to compare the means of a count variable (number of diving behaviors) across different groups (tidal stages). ANOVA is suitable for comparing means across multiple groups, which makes it appropriate for this scenario. -->

An Analysis of Variance test demonstrated that tidal class has a significant effect on the length of G. immer dive times (ANOVA, F_6,86 = 4.599; p = 0.000427). An uplanned analytical comparison demonstrated that G. immer dive times at low slack tide were signficantly different than those at mid ebb tide (TukeyB, p < 0.0005055), and dive lengths at high ebb tide were significantly different than those at mid ebb tide (TukeyB, p = 0.0017457). Otherwise, there were no significant differences in dive times between other tidal classes (TukeyB, p > 0.05)
